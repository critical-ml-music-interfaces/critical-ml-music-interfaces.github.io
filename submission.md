To participate in the workshop all you have to do is:

1. sign up!
2. send us an abstract (blog post) and a short bio to present on the website. Choose one of the four themes for your abstract: musicological perspectives; social and cultural impact; design and research methods; diversity and ethics.
3. Join for a 1-hour discussion on your theme (and the other themes if you want!) 
4. Discussions will occur over video conferencing as well in a communal discussion document / whiteboard. You can add to this at any time over the conference.
5. At the end of the conference, the discussions will be distilled into a framework that will be published on the website.

Links for submissions will be up soon!
