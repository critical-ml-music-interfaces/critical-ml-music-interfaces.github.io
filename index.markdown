Welcome to the _second_ NIME workshop on Critical Perspectives on AI/ML in Musical Interfaces!

### When is the workshop?

The workshop will be on **14**/6/2020 (depending on your timezone) in three sessions (times to be confirmed in NIME program):

| Session | PDT (UTC-7) | EDT (UTC-4) | UTC+0 | CST (UTC+8) | AEST (UTC+10) | NZST (UTC+12) |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1       | 17:00       | 20:00       | 00:00 | 08:00       | 10:00         | 12:00         |
| 2       | 01:00       | 04:00       | 08:00 | 16:00       | 18:00         | 20:00         |
| 3       | 09:00       | 12:00       | 16:00 | 00:00       | 02:00         | 04:00         |

See the [NIME Programme](https://nime2021.org) for registration details.

You are welcome to attend whichever session is most convenient for you, or more than one!

### How do I attend the workshop?

### How do I contribute?

See the ["Schedule and How this Works" page](schedule/) for instructions about how the workshop sessions will work and how you can contribute before, during, and after the synchronous sessions.

## Workshop Provocation

The use of machine learning and AI in everyday applications has taken off in recent years. Now, you can buy a refrigerator with “AI”, but, despite much media interest in “AI composers”, not a musical instrument (or perhaps, not a good one). This workshop seeks to develop a community of NIME researchers and practitioners to analyse the roles that computational intelligence already plays in music technology and where it may play a role in future.

This workshop follows up on a successful 2020 edition of “Critical Perspectives”. We aim to consolidate current ML-related thought in NIME, and to develop a research network that focuses on future work in ML-enhanced interfaces for musical performance. 

Notably, this objective diverges from previous NIME research that has focused on technical implementations; rather, we aim to offer a forum for academic discussions on critical and theoretical perspectives.

Our workshop format is online-first and inclusive in terms of geographic location and timezone as well as background and research area. We aim to include as many participants as possible.

Our workshop will be motivated by three themes, each the focus of one session, and a number of hard questions related to musical AI/ML:

#### Social and Cultural Impact (session 1):

- What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of using AI/ML in NIMEs?
- Is musical AI/ML a product of our techno-euphoric climate or will its effects be long-lasting?
- What will the effects be on enhancement and reduction of performers' creativity?
- What role could musical AI/ML have in education?

#### Musicological Perspectives (session 2):

- What are the roles of AI/ML in NIMEs?
- What kind of NIMEs and music technology does AI/ML afford?
- How can AI/ML affect musical practices?
- What distinguishes current/new applications of AI/ML to NIMEs from those already established?
- Can AI/ML-enabled instruments produce unique music?

#### Diversity and Ethics (session 3):

- What kind of musical bias could data used for training ML models potentially encapsulate?
- How should we cope with legal issues related to data ownership in ML-based NIMEs?
- How should we cope with the environmental issues related to the training of AI/ML for NIMEs?

Each 90-minute session will include three panellists from in- and outside of the NIME community, who will provide an orientation talk and discussion on the theme of the session. The rest of the session will involve directed discussions with the participants to develop a body of ML-related research perspectives with an eventual goal of developing an edited volume or journal special issue with contributions from the NIME community.
