Welcome to the first NIME workshop on Critical Perspectives on AI/ML in Musical Interfaces!

Submissions are now open for blog posts through [this form (link).](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJhT8SXipB-4jGUSGAAWD6n4n3n3nYe_vjwxn1SbBApD62lA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

## Workshop Provocation

The use of machine learning and AI in everyday applications has taken off in recent years. Now, you can buy a refrigerator with “AI”, but, despite much media interest in “AI composers”, not a musical instrument (or perhaps, not a good one). This workshop seeks to develop a community of NIME researchers and practitioners to analyse the roles that computational intelligence already plays in music technology and where it may play a role in future. 

We aim to consolidate current ML-related thought in NIME, and to develop a research network that focuses on future work in ML-enhanced interfaces for musical performance. Notably, this objective diverges from previous NIME research that has focused on technical implementations; rather, we aim to offer a forum for academic discussions on critical and theoretical perspectives. Our workshop will be motivated by four themes and a number of hard questions related to musical AI/ML:

### Musicological Perspectives:

- What are the roles of AI/ML in NIMEs?
- What kind of NIMEs and music technology does AI/ML afford?
- How can AI/ML affect musical practices?
- What distinguishes current/new applications of AI/ML to NIMEs from those already established?
- Can AI/ML-enabled instruments produce unique music?

### Social and Cultural Impact:

- What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of using AI/ML in NIMEs?
- Is musical AI/ML a product of our techno-euphoric climate or will its effects be long-lasting?
- What will the effects be on enhancement and reduction of performers' creativity?
- What role could musical AI/ML have in education?

### Design and Research Methods:

- What concepts other than computational creativity could drive the design of ML/AI in NIMEs?
- How to better include users in the musical AI/ML-design process?
- What evaluation methods could be developed for AI/ML with relevance to NIMEs?
- How can practice-based artistic research complement technical progress of AI/ML in NIMEs?

### Diversity and Ethics:

- What kind of musical bias could data used for training ML models potentially encapsulate?
- How should we cope with legal issues related to data ownership in ML-based NIMEs?
- How should we cope with the environmental issues related to the training of AI/ML for NIMEs?

The workshop will involve short talks from participants to frame their research topic and/or musical practices. Abstracts to present will be selected by the organisers with a short round of peer-review. Non-presenting participation will also be allowed. The bulk of the workshop will be focussed on community building and co-design activities. The outcomes of the workshop will be used to motivate an edited volume or special issue on the use of ML/AI in NIME interfaces and performance practices.

<!-- ## Draft Session Plan (4 hours planned) -->

<!-- - Introduction and provocations from organisers (30m) -->
<!-- - Short talks from participants introducing interests (60m - 5m each) -->
<!-- - Division into theme groups: what are the main ideas behind each theme? (60m) -->
<!-- - Design challenge: Towards framework for AI/ML in NIMEs (60m) -->

<!--

## Technical Requirements:

This workshop will be an academic forum, as such our technical requirements are light.

- Classroom or Seminar room
- Projector / Speakers
- HDMI and power for laptops to front of room
- WiFi and power in order to stream presentations if appropriate and enable virtual participation to increase potential for inclusion.
 
## Workshop Length:

We suggest a half-day workshop. -->

## Outcomes:

We intend that this workshop will lead to a special journal issue or edited volume on “Critical Perspectives on AI/ML in Musical Interfaces”.
