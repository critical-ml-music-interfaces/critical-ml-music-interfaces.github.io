The workshop is part of NIME2021 and the [conference schedule can be found here](http://nime2021.org/program/#/Schedule).

We have three 1.5-hour discussion sessions which will each focus on one theme. The three sessions are spaced out throughout the day to allow participants from any timezone to find an appropriate time to join us.

Collaborative documents and whiteboards will be available throughout the conference.

Should be fun!

### How Each Session Will Work:

1. Start in a Zoom Call and Slack Channel provided by NIME (check email for URL). Chat will take place in the NIME Slack.
2. The organisers will give a 5-minute intro to the session explaining the idea behind the session theme: explaining the workshop provocation, and then say what we expect of attendees (contribute their ideas and views on one or more themes.
3. Panellists each provide a 10-minute introduction to their perspective on the theme.
4. The panellists and organisers will discuss the theme and address questions arising from the group.
3. The workshop splits into breakout rooms for a 30- to 45-minute brainstorming sessions.
4. Last 10 minutes: come back together to look at what everybody came up with and distill some common points. The facilitator will show their screen to talk about the contributions everyody has made or each group could discuss their contributions.

### Slack Discussion

The discussion on Slack will be the main chat focus for the group and our way of producing a "proceedings" for the workshop. If you want to share any links, perspectives, or text, put it in the slack so we can find it later! :-D

### After the Workshop

The Slack channels be open until the end of NIME, and our workshop  [discord](https://discord.gg/cPb69Rh) will be open forever!

The 1.5 hour sessions are just a start for understanding this topic and you are free to continue the discussion throughout NIME. You might even like to use the workshop as a framework for understanding and discussing the NIME papers you see during the week.

At the end of the conference we will export the Slack chats and distill the discussions into a proceedings document to share.
