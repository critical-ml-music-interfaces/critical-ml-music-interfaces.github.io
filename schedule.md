The workshop is part of NIME2020 and the [conference schedule can be found here](https://nime2020.bcu.ac.uk/programme/).

We have three one-hour discussion sessions which will include a separate discussion room for each theme. The three sessions are spaced out throughout the day to allow participants from any timezone to find an appropriate time to join us.

1. 05:00 – 6:00 (GMT+1)
2. 13:00 – 14:00 (GMT+1)
3. 21:00 – 22:00 (GMT+1)

After the workshop day we will have asynchronous collaborations to arrange the discussions into a comprehensive framework that will serve to motivate future publication and presentation opportunitites!

Collaborative documents and whiteboards will be available throughout the conference.

Should be fun!

### How Each Session Will Work:

1. Start in a Zoom Call provided by NIME
2. The organisers will give a 5-minute intro to the session explaining the idea behind the four themes: expaining the workshop provocation, and then say what we expect of attendees (contribute their critical perspectives on one or more themes.
3. The workshop splits into breakout rooms for each theme for four 10-minute brainstorming sessions (one on each theme), if you don't want discuss a theme, you are free to stay on the one you are most passionate about!
4. Last 10 minutes: come back together to look at what everybody came up with and distill some common points. The facilitator will show their screen to talk about the contributions everyody has made or each group could discuss their contributions.

**Most importantly**: Everybody is contributing to an ongoing padlet with ideas and perspectives. Within Zoom breakouts you should discuss these ideas and come up with some new contributions.

**Logging into services**: You are free to contribute to the padlets and discord as an anonymous visitor, but if you would like to create an account it may help others to make some social connections during the workshop.

### Padlet Links

Here's a link to each padlet:

You can get started adding your ideas to the padlets right now!

### After the session:

The padlets will be open until the end of NIME, and the [discord](https://discord.gg/cPb69Rh) will be open forever!

The 1-hour meeting should be just to get you started (you won't have time to articulate all your best ideas), please join in afterwards and during the conference to add more to the padlets and keep the discussion going in the discord server!

You might even like to use the workshop as a framework for understanding and discussing the NIME papers you see during the week.

At the end of the conference we will export the padlets and distill the discussions into a series of blog posts.
