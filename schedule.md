Here you'll be able to find out the workshop schedule. (Dates/Times TBA)

We plan to have a one-hour discussion for each theme, with times scheduled for different timezones.

At the end we will have a collaborative session to arrange the discussions into a comprehensive framework that will serve to motivate future publication and presentation opportunitites!

Collaborative documents and whiteboards will be available throughout the conference.

Should be fun!
