### Charles Martin (Australian National University)

Charles Martin  is a Lecturer at the Australian National University Research School of Computer Science and was previously a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo's Robotics and Intelligent Systems Group. His PhD, on designing digital musical instruments to support ensemble improvisation was awarded from the Australian National University in 2016 and he also holds degrees in mathematics and music. Charles is a researcher in music technology, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. His research focus is on how intelligent systems can be deployed and evaluated in complex real-world situations, particularly in the creative arts. His musical works as a percussionist and computer musician have been performed throughout Australia, Europe and the USA and presented at international conferences on music technology and percussion.

### Fabio Morreale (University of Auckland)

Fabio Morreale is a Lecturer at the University of Auckland, School of Music. He was previously a postdoctoral research fellow at Queen Mary University of London (Augmented Instruments Lab) and at the University of Trento (interAction Lab). In 2015, he was awarded a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction from the University of Trento (Italy) and he holds a master degree in Computer Science. His research is aimed at critically assessing the impact of technology on music creation, learning, and consumption and at designing counterpowers and alternative futures. 

### Benedikte Wallace (University of Oslo)

Benedikte Wallace is a Doctoral Research Fellow at the RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies of Rhythm, Time and Motion at the University of Oslo.  With a background in music recording and a master degree in Informatics, her academic interests lie in the cross-section between art and science.  Her current research is centred around sound-motion mappings with 3D motion capture, generative machine learning and computational creativity. 

### Hugo Scurto (École nationale supérieure des Arts Décoratifs)

Hugo Scurto is a researcher, musician, and designer. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow at EnsadLab, the arts and design research lab of École nationale supérieure des Arts Décoratifs - Paris. He recently completed a PhD in Computer Music at IRCAM, entitled “Designing With Machine Learning for Interactive Music Dispositifs”, under the supervision of Frédéric Bevilacqua. Before that, he spent one year as a visiting researcher at Goldsmiths University of London, working with Rebecca Fiebrink on Human-Centred Machine Learning applied to Music. His research combines qualitative, quantitative, and practice-based methods to study, design, and inquire machine learning technology situated in human musical practices. His practice seeks to create new forms of interactive learning interfaces that critically take into account the creative, cultural, and inclusive dimensions of human musical expression.
